# GTAWS_v2 - GTA5 Wheel Spin Logger (version 2)
This is a cool little console app written in C# for GTA5 Online. 
It creates a text file on your Desktop containing your Lucky Wheel Spin timestamp.
It detects your game launcher and creates a log file specifed to that launcher type. 
For example, Steam Service = GTA5WSS.log and Epic Games Launcher = GTA5WSE.log.
If you forget to run it before you exit GTA5 and your game launcher is running; 
Then you are granted the option to still create a log file. Just type y or n then press the Enter key.
If you are real clever, you can build this project and program a hotkey on your keyboard to run the exe!
That way you can just press your function key and press the key you programed; 
Then the log file will be created automatically.
I know Rockstar released a feature for telling you the time remaining in the casion;
However, I personal like to know when I last spun the wheel without lauching GTA5.
Good luck on your Lucky Wheel Spins! Enjoy!
